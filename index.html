    <h1>Week 1</h1>
    <p>This week during PFD, I encountered the question our sponsors have set for my class, data collection. <br>
        To suit the assigned task, I came up with the idea for SEER, a tracking device capable of sending location data <br>
        in real-time to a database and pinging nearby devices to find places with high and low traffic on routes. <br><br>

        The SEER was made to streamline the data-collecting process of security guards; while also being lightweight and seamless.<br>
        I thought of the idea for SEER as I heard the current system for tracking security guards is QR code scanning, which is clunky<br> 
        and unable to capture the exact steps taken fully. <br><br>
        
        I was fortunate enough to have my idea elected as one of the top 5 and assembled a team capable of bringing <br>
        the vision to life together, which included me, my friend Jia Xian, Eddie and Jerel. I wanted a team that each brought<br>
        something to the table, thus I picked one team member that fell into a different category. <br><br>
        
        Jia Xian was confident in his coding ability, while Eddie prided himself on his UI/UX skills, lastly, Jerel was a <br>
        full-stack developer. After discussion, I was given the role of product master as I was the one who came up with the <br>
        concept and was deemed to have the clearest vision of what it should be, while Jia Xian was given the scrum master role. <br>

    <h1>Week 2</h1>
    <p> <img src="images/Seer_Product_Box.png" alt="SEER" width="400" height="600"> <br><br>
        
        This week, we discussed further the feasibility of the initial idea for SEER, we looked online for a device <br> 
        that would suit our needs, and the criteria were as follows, built-in GPS, wifi and Bluetooth capabilities,<br> 
        as well as easily programmable. <br><br>
  
        We required a GPS to track the wearer, with wifi access to broadcast the location data to a database. <br>
        Lastly, Bluetooth was for us to possibly allow the device to ping gentries set up between levels of a building to <br>
        indicate which floor the wearer is on or is ascending or descending to. <br><br>
       
        This week we fully visualised what features our product should ideally possess and methods on how to achieve this <br>
        functionality. To this end, on top of having data transmitted in real-time to a database, we would also seek to create a <br>
        program that could plot out the route taken by wearers using the location data from the database. We also floated the idea <br>
        of creating gentries to track which floor a guard could be on. <br><br>

        <img src="images/Project_Plan.png" alt="SEER" width="400" height="400"> <br><br>
       
        As for how we planned to fulfil this suite of promised features, we would utilise DynamoDB to store our location data which <br>
        could then be pulled from by managers to feed into our route plotting program which would use MapPlotLib to visualise the data. <br>
        Lastly for gentries we would use Bluetooth to ping gentries to update the level wearers are on in the database. <br><br>
       </p>

  <div class="text-chunk">
    <h1>Week 3</h1>
    <p>This week my team received its ESP32 NodeMCU, however, unfortunately, our GPS was not yet ready, thus this week was spent mostly<br> 
        getting ready for the GPS, another thing we were also waiting on was our DynamoDB which similarly was not usable yet. <br><br>
     
        <img src="images/Materials.jpg" alt="SEER" width="400" height="400"> <br><br>

        Due to the lack of ability to make much headway in the project, I do not have much to report on the progress this week, except <br>
        Jia Xian was working on understanding how to use the ESP32 MCU, performing several tests on it to explore how to use it in later weeks. <br>
        As we could not work on the ESP32 at the same time, I could only oversee the work as Jerel had taken the other task this week, which <br>
        tried to get the MapPlotLib working. <br><br> 
      </p>
  </div>

  <div class="text-chunk">
    <h1>Week 4</h1>
    <p>
        Another unfortunate event occurred this week with both the GPS and DynamoDB still not being available, the GPS <br>
        was caught in transit while the status of our DynamoDB was unknown. This hampered progress as it meant we had to <br>
        get everything running during the two-day hackathon on week 5, without having any time beforehand to prepare.<br><br>
   
        <img src="images/GPS_Map.png" alt="SEER" width="400" height="400"> <br><br>

        However, some good news this week was that Jerel had managed to get MatPlotLib working, using fabricated data as our GPS <br>
        had not yet arrived to create a graph of the route taken by a theoretical security guard in the Ngee Ann Polytechnic premises. <br>
        It's able to read a csv file containing the location data and creates a plot based on the data within it. The graph is also <br>
        able to be saved as a png file for future reference. <br><br>

  <div class="text-chunk">
    <h1>Week 5</h1>
    <p>This week was the Hackathon, and our GPS system had finally arrived, meaning that Jia Xian could finally begin work on the ESP32. <br>
        However, we were still unable to use the DynamoDB, as it was not ready yet, meaning we had to cut this functionality for the <br>
        presentation on friday.<br><br>

        Me and Eddie were tasked with creating an accompanying website for our product, which would be used to display the data from the <br>
        database, when it was able to be set up. I also designed a new Icon for the SEER product, as the previous design we had used we could <br>
        no longer find. <br><br>

        <img src="images/newSeer_Product_Box.png" alt="SEER" width="400" height="400"> <br><br>

        A piece of good news was that we had already finished our presentation slides weeks in advance, and we were able to focus on the <br>
        product itself, rather than the presentation.  <br><br>

        Jia Xian had attempted to get the GPS to work, however it was unable to output any data, and we were unable to figure out why. <br>
        This meant that we were unable to get the GPS to work in time for the presentation, and we had to cut it from the presentation. <br>
        We only had the MatPlotLib to show for our efforts, and was not able to show it with our website as it still was in development <br>
        by friday. <br><br>

        As the product owner, I deemed that despite all this we were still able to show the potential of our product, as the most impressive <br>
        part of the product was Jerel's progam being able to plot out routes using only location data. Thus I was still hopeful that we could <br>
        hold a successful presentation, and even win first place within our class. <br><br>

        On Friday I introduced the product to the class, and explained the features of the product, and how it would be used. I shared my vision <br>
        of the product, and how it would be used to streamline the data collection process for security guards. I also explained how the product <br>
        would be used to track the location of security guards, and how it would be used to plot out routes taken by security guards. <br><br>

        <img src="images/Elevator_Pitch.png" alt="SEER" width="600" height="600"> 
        <br> 

        Jia Xian and Jerel also explained their parts of the project, and how they contributed to the project. Jia Xian explained how he was <br>
        tried to get the ESP32 to work, and how it would be used to track the location of the security guards. Jerel explained how he was able <br>
        to get MatPlotLib to work, and performed a live demonstration of the program to our sponsor. <br><br>

        We were unable to win as our project was not as complete as one of the other's in my class, however I was still proud of my team's <br>
        efforts, and I was glad that we were able to complete the project to the best of our abilities, especially with us having only two <br>
        days to work with the actual GPS and still being unable to access the database. <br>

  <div class="text-chunk">
    <h1>Week 12 & 13</h1>
    <p>
        At the start of the new term, we continued work on the project, and we were able to get the GPS to work, as we had ordered a new GPS <br>
        which was able to output data. We were also able to get the DynamoDB to work, and we were able to get the ESP32 to send data to the <br>
        DynamoDB. <br><br>

        <img src="images/ESP32.png" alt="SEER" width="600" height="450"> <br><br>

        The next step was getting the pyscript to work, and we were able to get it to work, however I had encountered a problem where the <br>
        pyscript was unable to run on my end and as I was tasked with creating the website, I was unable to deliver this functionality to my team. <br>
        The pyscript was extremely important as it could display our data in a more readable format, as it would read the data from the database<br>
        and output a map using the datapoints, which would be more readable than the raw data. Thus I will have to work on this in the coming weeks, <br> 
        as currently it was unusable. <br><br>

        initally we had planned to use flask to run the script on the website however when I tested using it the script did not run at all, <br>
        as when I tried to run it individually and not through the website it failed to run and no images were created using our test data. <br> 
        I found that cartopy was the problem, however even after using pip -install cartopy it still did not work. <br><br>

        <img src="images/Error.png" alt="SEER" width="900" height="600"> <br><br>

        Thus I was forced to have to resolve this issue the following week as there was no way to get the script to work on the website. <br><br>
        
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="text-chunk">
    <h1>Week 14</h1>
    <p>
      The next week, I was able to get the pyscript to work, and I was able to get the website to display the data from the database. <br>
      I was able to get the pyscript to work by using the command prompt, and I was able to get the website to display the data by using <br>
      flask to run the script. <br><br>

      <img src="images/Website.png" alt="SEER" width="600" height="600"> <br><br>

      Afterwards I moved to improving the website's design, by touching up the website's design, fixing the previously unformatted text, <br>
      and improving the website's layout. <br> 
      
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="text-chunk">
    <h1> Week 15</h1>
    <p>
      This week was focused on further improving the design of the website as the other portions are complete. I was able to improve the <br>
      website's design by making it responsive to different screen sizes, and I was able to improve the website's layout by making it more <br>
      readable. <br><br>

      <img src="images/Responsive.png" alt="SEER"> <br><br>

      The navbar was made to shrink when the screen size was reduced making it usable even on phones, and the text was made to be more readable <br>
      on larger screens by increasing the font size. I had accounted for bigger screens as well when making the website more responsive, as<br>
      I realised using my larger monitor, the text was too small on my device, and realised that I should not only focus on a working mobile view<br>
      but also a working desktop view. <br><br>

      <img src="images/Responsive2.png" alt="SEER"> <br><br>
      

    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="text-chunk">
    <h1> Week 16</h1>
    <p>
      This week was spent polishing up the remaining parts of the website, and I added more details to the website, including a new <br>
      contact page, and further improved the website's design. <br><br>

      <img src="images/Contact.png" alt="SEER" width=100% height=100%> <br><br>

      However my group decided to redo all my work, as they were not satisfied with the website's design, and they wanted to improve <br>
      it by integrating it to a new template. <br><br>

    </p>
  </div>


  <div class="text-chunk">
    <h1> Tech Assessment </h1>
    <p>
      In week 17 I took the time to do the tech assessment, and I was able to get a better understanding of my current competencies, <br>
      and I was able to see what I needed to improve on. <br><br>

      I performed poorer on programming concepts than I had expected, as I encountered many questions where I have never been taught <br>
      the answers for, thus I was unable to answer them. I also performed poorly on the questions regarding the use of databases, <br>
      as I also had not learnt how to use them. <br><br>

      I will strive towards filling these gaps in my knowledge in the coming weeks, and I will work on improving my programming skills <br>
      in time for my internship. <br><br>
